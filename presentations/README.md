# Presentations and Resources
This folder holds useful resources and presentations that I've run across.

This is the presentation I gave that spawned this repository at Splunk .conf 2021:
* [extending-spl-with-custom-search-commands-and-the-splunk-sdk-for-python-2018.pdf](extending-spl-with-custom-search-commands-and-the-splunk-sdk-for-python-2018.pdf)

These presentations are from past versons of .conf, and were done by former Splunker Jacob Leverich. They are very helpful in understanding the protocol (although there is a focus on the Python SDK).
